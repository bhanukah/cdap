																<p align="justify">Researches have been done on chatbots in different areas focused on community services such as virtual teaching assistants for open e-learning platforms, intelligent web-based voice chatbots, question answering bots for API documentation and chatbots made for banking purposes. There is a chatbot that shows how integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help students as well as tutors across the learning process within an open source e-learning platform. Especially, there are T-BOT and Q-BOT, a couple of chatter bots capable of tutoring and evaluating students using open platforms as Moodle or Claroline.</p>

																<p align="justify">
																A past research ‘A multiagent assistant for legal research’ has been done specifically regarding legal assistant chatbots. In this research, it collects and organizes the status and case histories relevant to a legal search. That’s actually for easy search of legal information for public.
																</p>
																
																<p align="justify">
																There are lot of downsides in the existing systems and through Lawbot, we have proposed a solution addressing these downsides of the existing systems for the legal assistance.

																<p align="justify">Majority of the people today has a very limited knowledge in the existing laws and legal systems. When people encounter a situation in their day today life where they need legal advice/ assistance, most people have very limited knowledge or sometimes no idea of the prevailing laws related to that situation. They go through lot of hardships to get the necessary, accurate legal advice. In such situations, what people often do is go to a place where they 
think they can get the legal advisory service done or they tend to hire a lawyer. This way involves lot of time, cost and most of the time it’s inefficient. Sometimes they might have come to the wrong place seeking for information. On the other hand, what often happens is people tend to assume things and jump into conclusions. They do this with the very limited knowledge they have and sometimes looking in to another person’s similar situation and the outcome of that incident. This way they may end up with false and misleading information and the results can be disastrous.</p>
																<p align="justify">There are legal information providing websites and legal assistant apps where people needs to login first, search for the necessary information, filter out what they actually need. This way is again time consuming and can be very inefficient. Most of them are not free information providing sources.    To address the above mentioned issues, we are proposing a legal assistant chatbot, a platform designed to understand, learn and converse like a human and answer ad-hoc queries in real time.  It will assist people in their legal issues related to 3 specific areas which were finalised through a survey conducted on the community. They are,  </p>
																<p align="justify">1. Road accidents - pedestrian and vehicle accidents</p>
																<p align="justify">2. Citizen's Registrations -  obtaining new NIC, obtaining certified copy of marriage, birth, death certificate, voter registrations</p>
																<p align="justify">3. Employment Information - about pensions, EPF, ETF </p>

																<p align="justify">Chatbots have been introduced to automate most of the manually done work in almost all the areas today and have been identified as the most efficient way to handle user inputs. But when it comes to legal related areas, it has been considered as an area, where it is hard to be replaced by the chatbots as legal information is considered to be extremely accurate , confidential and sensitive information so that people believe they need to be provided by a lawyer or a legally certified body. Otherwise people are reluctant to go for other legal information providing sources. Therefore, researches done related to chatbots developed for legal areas are hardly found.</p>

																<p align="justify">At the beginning of the research a survey was conducted on the community with the aim of finding the areas where people frequently seek legal assistance. Our key questions were to find how often people encounter problems in life where they need legal assistance, how they normally seek assistance when they encounter such questions and mainly what kind of problems they face when they need legal assistance. Through the survey results, it was revealed although around 75% of the responses said they encounter legal issues at yearly basis, almost everyone had no proper way to seek the assistance they need. 82% of responses said their approach when met with a legal issue was to ask from someone who has expertise in law. 42% searched web while others sought the assistance from friends/relatives. 60% said they would go for a social platform, if there’s such social platform available to get legal assistance. Out of all the legal issues people had shared, road accidents, citizen's registrations and employment information were at the top. Therefore the research scope was set to develop the Lawbot only for the above mentioned three legal areas.</p>
																
																<p align="justify">Through the results of the survey and interviews held with colleagues and friends, it was revealed that people need an efficient way to get their necessary legal advice without wanting to waste their money, effort and time. therefore the research proposes to develop a lawbot, first Sri Lankan legal assistant chatbot which assists people with the issues they have regarding  Sri Lankan laws.</p>
																
																<p align="justify">First question that encountered after finalizing to develop a chatbot was whether people would like to go for a social platform since lot of people in Sri Lanka are still reluctant to believe in internet related contemporary approaches which don’t involve human interaction. Through the survey, around 60% said they would like to go for a social platform.</p>
																
																<p align="justify">By nature people are always comfortable interacting with humans than interacting with systems, NLP is used to add the human like interaction which makes all the questions and answers to be in the form of a conversation. With NLP, chatbot can be trained on the various interactions it will go through and help streamline the responses it outputs. For the most part, training consists of providing examples of content it will encounter. Providing more examples to the chatbot gives it a wider basis with which it can interpret and answer questions and commands.</p>
																
																<p align="justify">When it comes to training the chatbot, users feedback and queries itself will be used when the chatbot is being used by people.</p>
